## 4. Proposed Resolution & Protocol Decision
- Specify clear interface contracts and execution requirements addressing this gap.
- Maintain deterministic state across pipeline boundaries and fail-soft fallbacks.

## 5. Open Questions & Residual Risk
- [ ] Are additional integration tests required to verify protocol compliance?
- [ ] Does this resolution introduce cross-platform drift across runtime targets?
